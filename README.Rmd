<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of statslearnr is to allow students to test their knowledge about statistics.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("statisticsforsocialscience/statslearnr")
```
## How to run

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(statslearnr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
